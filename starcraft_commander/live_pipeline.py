"""Live StarCraft II command pipeline: text -> intent -> plan -> narration.

This is the handoff Step 5 integration seam. One :class:`SC2CommandSession`
composes the Korean command interpreter (reused from the ToyCraft offline
harness, the one legitimate toycraft import in this package), the live
feasibility validator, the semantic SC2 action planner, the lifecycle-aware
runtime executor, the BotAI state resolver, and the Korean narrator into a
single async ``process_text`` call that returns one structured
:class:`SC2CommandOutcome` per executed (or honestly refused) command part.

The module is intentionally importable without StarCraft II, python-sc2,
faster-whisper, or sounddevice installed: every composed component is either
stdlib-only or lazy about its optional runtime, and bot objects are always
duck-typed. Conservative house rules apply end to end: unknown game state
rejects mutating commands, planner refusals surface their full supported
target listing, and skipped runtime work is never narrated as success.

    planner, a fresh (unbound) runtime executor, the duck-typed BotAI state
    resolver, and the Korean narrator. Bind a runtime by constructing the
    session with ``executor=SC2RuntimeExecutor(bot=adapter)`` where ``adapter``
    is typically a ``PythonSC2BotAdapter`` wrapping the live BotAI object.

    - ``event_memory`` (``record(outcome, game_time_seconds=None)``, for
